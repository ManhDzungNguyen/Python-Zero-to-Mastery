# Python Zero to Mastery

This repository is created for Python beginners to help them learn and remember common Python syntax and with intermediate and advanced Python developers as a handy reference.

The original repo can be found in here: <https://github.com/aneagoie/ztm-python-cheat-sheet>

My repo not only includes the original repo's infomation but also contains my own notes, implementations and example which could help you understand easier.
